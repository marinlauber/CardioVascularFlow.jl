#### 2-3D arterial stenosis

The steosis is modelled as a simple harmonic constriction of the form 
$$h(x,r) = \begin{cases}
\frac{\sqrt{\text{stenosis}}}{2}(1-2\cos(2Ï€ x/D)), & 5D \le x \le 5.5D\\
0, & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$ 

where $D$ is the diameter of the artery and $\text{stenosis}$ is the percentage of the stenosis. The stenosis is modelled in 2D and 3D. The 2D stenosis is shown below

the velocity profiles obtained from the simulation are shown below

#### 3D radially averaged results

In 3D, the simulation is axisymmetric and the results are radially averaged. The velocity profiles obtained from the simulation are shown below (these are instantaneous results)
